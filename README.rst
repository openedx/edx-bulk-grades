Support for bulk scoring and grading. This adds models and an API for reading and modifying
scores and grades in bulk.

Overview
---------

The ``README.rst`` file should then provide an overview of the code in this
repository, including the main components and useful entry points for starting
to understand the code in more detail.
edx-bulk-grades is a library that runs under lms. It uses the configuration settings defined in lms as well.
In order to use, the library must be installed into edx-platform.

Using with Docker Devstack
--------------------------
Prerequisite: Have your Open edX https://github.com/openedx/devstack properly installed.
Note: When you see "from inside the lms" below, it means that you've run ``make lms-shell`` from your devstack directory
and are on a command prompt inside the LMS container.

1. | Clone this repo into ``../src/`` directory (relative to your "devstack" repo location). This will mount the directory
   | in a way that is accessible to the lms container.

2. From inside the lms, uninstall bulk-grades and reinstall your local copy. You can just copy the following line::

    pip uninstall edx-bulk-grades -y; pip install -e /edx/src/edx-bulk-grades

   Or, you can run the following make command::

    make install-local

3. Now, get your bulk-grades development environment set up::

    cd /edx/src/edx-bulk-grades
    virtualenv edx-bulk-grades-env
    source edx-bulk-grades-env/bin/activate
    make requirements

Making Code Changes
-------------------

1. | After checking out a new branch, increment ``__version__`` by the smallest possible value located in ``bulk_grades/__init__.py``.
   | This will allow edx-platform to pick up the new version.

2. | Once a branch has been merged, it is necessary to make a release on github, specifying the new version from
   | ``__version__`` set above.

3. In order for platform to use the newest version of bulk-grades, it is necessary to run the::

    $ make upgrade

from docker shell of edx-platform. This will increment the version of edx-bulk-grades to the correct one.

4. Once the code from step 3 is merged, this will trigger deployment of the correct versions of edx platform and bulk-grades.

Unit Testing
------------
mock_apps folder: Since bulk_grades depends on platform during actual runtime, for unit tests, we need to mock various
endpoints and calls. To this end, they are mocked in the mock_apps folder.

Since edx-bulk grades runs under platform, it is necessary to connect to platform docker::

    $ make lms-shell

followed by::

    $ cd /edx/src/edx-bulk-grades
    make test

This will run the unit tests and code coverage numbers
